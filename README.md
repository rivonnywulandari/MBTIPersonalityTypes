âœ¨ğŸ“± MBTI Personality App ğŸ“±âœ¨

Inspired by the 16personalities website, I created a simple Android App using Kotlin that showcases the 16 personality types from the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and provides detailed descriptions to help users understand themselves and others better ğŸ¤—ğŸ’« 

The app features a main page with a list of all 16 personality types, a detail page for each type, an about page, and a splash screen for a polished user experience
